# NLP Lao–English Text Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis of Lao and English texts. The objective is to compare word usage patterns between the two languages by applying text preprocessing, frequency analysis, and data visualization techniques using Python.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and includes clear results and discussion supported by visual diagrams.

## Project Structure
- `lao_english_text_analysis.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## Methodology
The workflow of this project follows these steps:
1. **Data Collection** – Text data in Lao and English is collected from relevant sources.
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Cleaning, normalization, and tokenization of the text data.
3. **Frequency Analysis** – Identification of the most frequently used words in each language.
4. **Visualization** – Creation of charts to compare word frequencies.
5. **Results and Discussion** – Interpretation of findings based on the generated diagrams.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- collections (Counter)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/nanamiKJW/NLP-Lao-English.git]

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd REPO_NAME

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

4. Install dependencies


5. Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook


## Results
The analysis produces visual diagrams showing the most frequent words in Lao and English texts. These results highlight linguistic patterns and differences in word usage between the two languages.

## Discussion
The findings provide insight into language structure and common vocabulary usage. The visual comparisons support a clearer understanding of linguistic characteristics and can be extended for further NLP research.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how basic NLP techniques can be applied to multilingual text analysis. It serves as a foundation for more advanced language processing tasks such as topic modeling or sentiment analysis.
